# STM32F410RB Nucleo Drivers

These are the drivers produced whilst working through the excellent [Mastering Microcontroller with Peripheral Development] (https://www.udemy.com/mastering-microcontroller-with-peripheral-driver-development/) course on Udemy. 


This work is mostly a straight up copy of what the instructor does with a few adjustments made to make things work with the F410RB.
